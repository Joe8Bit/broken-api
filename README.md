## The broken API

You've been teaching Little Timmy about JavaScript and NodeJS, but he hasn't had much luck and everything keeps breaking! Luckily, to help him you set him with a node project and wrote some tests to make sure he's doing a good job!

He'd like you to help him by fixing his API, then you can talk him through what you did to fix it!

Don't let Little Timmy down, he's counting on you!
